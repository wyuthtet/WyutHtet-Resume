        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated from Gabrielino high school as an honor student in the class of 2019. During my high school years, I actively participated in Interact Rotary Club and completed 60 hours of community services with the club. I also started my own club known as Kclub which mainly focused on learning and spreading appreciation for Korean culture. I was a vice president for Kclub during junior year and later promoted to President. Not only we were involved in helping others learn about the culture, but we also perform Kpop cover at the rallies and school events. As a president and also in charge of the dance, I was able to use my leadership skills by having to teach about 40 people the choreography and organized it to perform. <br>I was not only involved in school clubs but also outside activities like having a leadership role in a nonprofit organization called Youth Society For Education. I was given the role of Fundraising Project Manager and had to oversee our organization's fund. As the whole organization, We hosted fundraising and collect donations to buy school supplies for rural places in Burma. We have different branches throughout California and last year, we were able to raise enough money into building a school in Burma. During my time in the organization, I hosted three big events on my own and one of them is having a food booth at a festival to raise money. 
        <br>Now I am a current first year at the University of California, Riverside as a pre-business major. After I successfully transfer to the School of Business, I am planning to concentrate on Marketing. As a freshman, I wasn't able to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities that I wanted to since the school year was cut short. First I become a member of a club called UCR SHARP which as a club, we meet up once a week to make peanut butter jelly sandwiches and care packets to give to the people who are less fortunate. I also join a club called Hallyucr where they provide a comfortable environment for the people with the same interest of learning about Korean culture and also a sub dance team called Tartan Seoul. I was able to join the dance team and release official cover on the team youtube place. I was also able to perform at the fall showcase and winter showcase with the UCI team. With my connection at Tartan Seoul, I was fortunate enough to land an internship at the Hallyucr as a marketing intern. As an intern, I shadowed my mentor and learned about photoshopping and handling the club's social media account. But with quarantine, I wasn't fully able to complete my internship. For my next remaining three years at UCR, I hope to participate in research and be more involved in other organizations on campus. I also hope to land a campus job that will help me grow in the career that I am planning to go to. <br>
